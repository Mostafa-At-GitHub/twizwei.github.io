    title: About Me
    summary: |
      I am currently a first-year Ph.D student at [Virginia Tech](http://vt.edu/) working with Prof. [Jia-Bin Huang](https://filebox.ece.vt.edu/~jbhuang/). Prior to this, I obtained my M.S. degree from [UC San Diego](http://www.ece.ucsd.edu/), advised by Prof. [Nuno Vasconcelos](http://www.svcl.ucsd.edu/~nuno/), and my B.E. degree from [South China University of Technology (SCUT)](https://en.scut.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Junbo Zhang](https://web.stanford.edu/group/sdgc/scholarjbz.html), respectively.

      My research interest includes Computer Vision and Machine Learning. I am interested in implementing Computer Vision for beauty industry (e.g. generative models for facial make-ups). I used to work on the scene understanding for Self-Driving. My CV is available [here](../assets/images/Yiran_CV.pdf).

        details: A new paradigm is proposed for autonomous driving. The new paradigm lies between the end-to-end and pipelined approaches, and is inspired by how humans solve the problem. The objects that could originate hazard are denoted as action-inducing. They also define a set of explanations for these actions, which should be produced jointly with the latter. An extension of the BDD100K dataset is proposed. A new multi-task formulation of the problem, which optimizes the accuracy of both action commands and explanations, is then introduced. A CNN architecture is finally proposed to solve this problem.
